# molecule-binder

molecule-binder contains a Unity project that creates the very primitive skeleton for Protein Structure Builder.

At present, the current golas for molecule-binder are to get two prefabs that look like simple molecules to snap together when the colliders on their atoms collide with each other. Hopeful steps forward include:

1) Have the atoms change color when the colliders are triggered (Done)

2) Have the atoms snap together when the colliders are triggered (in progress)

3) Apply rules to the snapping based on the type of atom or type of molecule. This needs some further thought. Possible rules include rotation angles, and whether the snap is allowed in the first place

4) Apply the program to more complicated meshes, using unique rulesets for each mesh.

5) Apply the program to meshes generated by PyMol, to provide the real basis for Protein Structure Builder
